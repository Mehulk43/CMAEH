# CMAEH ICPR 2024
CMAEH: Contrastive masked autoencoder based hashing for efficient image retrieval
International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024

## Architecture
![CMAEH](fig/CMAEH.png)

This code uses the Masked AutoEncoder Vision Transformer (ViT) code and pretrained model ([https://github.com/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch] [(https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae)] and DeepHash framework (https://github.com/swuxyj/DeepHash-pytorch).

Download the MAE-ViT pretrained models from official repository and keep under pretrainedVIT directory:
[https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae]


Download data from https://github.com/swuxyj/DeepHash-pytorch for different dataset, if not already present under data directory.
